# Zphisher-PornHub-Edition
A couple of screenshot of my social engineering job here.

This version of Zphisher by Tahmid Rayat improves the social engineering aspect which is very important aspect in the phishing process.
In Phishing does't mind "How much good you are at hacking" rather than "How much good you are are at tricking".

Well guys, sexual scam or sexual extorsion are too aggressive social engineering attacks which great synergy with phishing,
your targets might not fill the form in order to give you their passwords but a well performed sexual scam along with a good edited phishing page
will make them shit their pants for sure.
So this repository is not providing
any content, just screenshots. That's why Tahmid is never going to add porn sites on his own repository, me and him are not responsible for your shit.

For that reason, this repository just have a couple of screenshot of my job and not my edited version of Zphisher.
Also there is no way a script kiddie use these software for educational purpose.

My name is Mart3s and I created this my own version of Zphisher for challenge since I am very new at programming, I have just some knowledge of HTML, Python and Bash.
I hope I will improve more and more, to start I decided to edit some of the popular softwares created by hackers which are for sure better than me.

I assume no responsability if you try to understand how I edited his tool. If you have an ethical code but you are lazy to start your own tool from 0
then you can try to do edit it on your own but then don't hurt anyone my fucking friend ok?

List of social engineering changes:
1. Changed the Instagram 1.000 followers page: now the page seems more like a request of help in order to increase your own followers, rather than a simple
sponsorship. Those who are more more altruistic could be exposed to this type of phishing page if they are unaware.

2. Added the PornHub phishing page, which open doors for insane social engineering tricks. By editing the PornHub page with your HTML skill you can manipulate your
target curiosity and push him into login. You can also manipulate their fear to get them logged in, you can say for example that they are being impersonated
on PornHub by someone who looks like them, and spoofing their name and last name.

I hope this will make people aware of this type of attacks. If someone ping at you then say "Look, you are on Pornhub" just block him.

This is for educational purpose, Mart3s.
